# Gratuity Calculator

## Description
This Python script calculates **gratuity** and the **total bill amount** based on:
- The **subtotal** before gratuity.
- The **gratuity rate** (percentage).

This project helps in understanding **basic financial calculations and Python scripting**, essential for a **Software Development Apprentice**.

## Features
- Computes **gratuity amount** based on user input.
- Calculates the **total bill including gratuity**.
- Implements **error handling** for invalid inputs.
- Displays results in a **formatted output**.

## How to Use
1. Run the script using Python.
2. Enter the required values:
   - Subtotal amount before gratuity.
   - Gratuity rate in percentage.
3. The program will display the **gratuity amount** and **total bill**.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gratuity_calculator.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd gratuity_calculator
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python gratuity_calculator.py
   ```

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for **split bills** among multiple people.
- Implement a **graphical user interface (GUI)** using Tkinter.
- Include **currency formatting** for different locales.

## Relevance to Software Development Apprenticeship
- Demonstrates **Python programming for financial calculations**.
- Reinforces **user input validation and exception handling**.
- Strengthens understanding of **basic arithmetic computations**.
